# Hi there üëã

I'm Josh, a software engineer passionate about functional programming, type safety, and building practical tools that make developers' lives easier.

## üöÄ Featured Projects

### [fp-tsm](https://github.com/jderochervlk/fp-tsm)
A modern continuation of `fp-ts` that brings functional programming concepts like `Option`, `Either`, and `Future` to TypeScript in a lightweight, ESM-only package. Perfect for developers who want practical FP patterns without the complexity of larger frameworks.

**Tech:** TypeScript, Deno, Functional Programming  
**Documentation:** https://fp-tsm.jvlk.dev/

### [rescript-fresh](https://github.com/jderochervlk/rescript-fresh)
ReScript bindings for Deno's Fresh framework, making it easy to build type-safe, server-rendered web applications with ReScript.

**Tech:** ReScript, Deno, Fresh  
**Stars:** ‚≠ê 5

### [Plex Movie Night](https://github.com/jderochervlk/plex-movie-night)
A fun app that helps you see what movies your friends want to watch that you have on your Plex server. Built with Deno, ReScript, and Fresh, deployed on Deno Deploy.

**Tech:** ReScript, Deno, Fresh, Plex API  
**Stars:** ‚≠ê 2

### [fp-ts Libraries](https://github.com/jderochervlk/typescript-libraries)
A collection of TypeScript libraries including:
- **fp-ts-fetch**: Fetch wrappers for fp-ts with better type safety
- **fp-ts-remote-data**: Handle remote data states elegantly (Loading, Error, Empty, Success)

**Tech:** TypeScript, Functional Programming

## üíª What I Work With

- **Languages:** TypeScript, ReScript, JavaScript
- **Runtimes:** Deno, Node.js
- **Paradigms:** Functional Programming, Type-Driven Development
- **Tools:** Parcel, Vite, ast-grep
- **Interests:** Developer tooling, ESM, functional abstractions, type safety

## üéØ Current Focus

I'm actively working on making functional programming more accessible in the TypeScript ecosystem. My projects focus on:

- Creating lightweight, practical FP libraries that are easy to adopt
- Building ReScript tooling and bindings for modern JavaScript runtimes
- Exploring better developer experiences through type safety and functional patterns
- Contributing to the Deno ecosystem
